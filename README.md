# 100 Days Of Code Diary

I will be documenting my progress for the #100daysOfCode challenge

## Day 1

Today was the welcome day for the School of Code, We had a 2-hour session where we got to meet other bootcampers and some of the leadership team.
We went through some of the basics of HTML and CSS.

We went into the different types of tags used in HTML, such as:
anchor tags, paragraphs, headers, titles, image tags

I also played around with my own basic webpage which made to have a title, Header, a paragraph and an image in the body tag.
I found the image on google and linked the image url to display on my webpage.

## Day 2

Today I wanted to familiarise myself with DOM manipulation in JS. I found an exercise on W3 Schools with 9 exercises which helped with the topic and completed it. The link was: https://www.w3schools.com/js/exercise_js.asp?filename=exercise_js_dom_html1
It helped me get better at knowing when to use InnerText and InnerHTML. I also learnt how to change text colour, font size and whether to display text or not using purely JS DOM manipulation

Completed the JS quiz https://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=JS and scored 19/25, I felt confident as I have done some JS before. However I was aiming for atleast 20/25 so I felt unhappy. I will attempt this again in a few weeks and hopefully get the full marks.

## Day 3

Monday 13th March 2023
Today was the first day of School of Code where I learnt a lot of brand new information about the best way to learn and be efficient at problem solving.

We were also introduced to https://flukeout.github.io which is a task which helps you learn more about how css selectors work. We worked in three's and completed questions on the website and I carried on attempting questions after the session in my own time too.

## Day 4

Tuesday 14th March 2023

Today we delve into the basics on javascript and learnt about integers, strings booleans and basic programming in JS

## Day 5

Wednesday 15th March 2023

We explored creating objects and acessing different elements within an object. I also learnt how dictionarys and objects are similiar as they both have keys and values.

## Day 6

Thursday 16th March 2023

Today we delve into Arrays and being able to access different elements in the array. I learnt new commands such as reverse, pop, push, shift and unshift that are used in array manipulation. We also explored nested arrays, with arrays and objects with arrays. I also learnt about string interpolation which is done using the dollar sign.

## Day 7

Friday 17th March 2023

Today I completed a hackathon with my pair programming parter. We had a series of task that we broke down into smaller tasks. The aim was to make a rock paper scissors game in JS using input from the user. We used prompts and alerts to notify and takd input from the user.

We completed this successfully along side the bonus tasks. I then used a template provided by SOC to further create another versiokn of the rock-paper-scissors which this time used buttons on the web page and displayed the result of the game too. I enjoyed the task quite a lot as it required me to learn new concepts and implement them in a working project.

## Day 8

Saturday 19th March 2023

I experimented with the pokemon api and was able to fetch characteristics of the pokemon based on the pokemon name or ID submitted. I became more familiar with JSON files and how to access information from them. I also learnt about how to fetch from an api and manipulate the data. I've uploaded the work I completed on github.

## Day 9

Monday 20th March

I learn about what the DOM is in javascript and how js can be used to manipulate the DOM
and how this does not change the underlying html file.
I had tasks where I had to change parts of the DOM using querySelector and innerText/ textContent/innerHtml

## Day 10

Tuesday 21st March

I cemented my knowledge by practising more DOM manipulation and used EventListeners in java script.
I used event listeners with buttons presses and mouse clicks and more on the website and called functions which
changed the appearance of the page once it was activated.

## Day 11

## Day 16

Monday 27th March

Today I learnt about how UI/UX matter a lot when creating products for consumers. It is literally
the difference between having a super succesful product and a product that will never be used.
I also attempted 2 CSS-based games, where I learnt more about how to align-items, justify-content, wrap-text and
more. I feel like i'm less knowledgable in CSS compared to JS, however the activities I completed today really helped
me consolidate my knowledge of CSS.

## Day 17

Enjoyed my weekend off and did not touch much code at all.

## Day 44 - 48 Front End Project Week:

Monday 24th April - Friday 28th April

Worked in a team of 4 to create this project.

The problem we all faced was studying and revising content we had learnt in the bootcamp.
We wanted to create a web app that would help us revise and test our knowledge on the content we had learnt.
This led us to create 'Memory Masters', a flashcard webapp built in react

We used the agile methodology to create this app. We had daily standups and retrospectives to make sure we were on track.
We used Trello to keep track of our tasks and used a kanban board to keep track of our progress.
We built user profiles, and used dot voting to come up with our web application.

We built components trees and decided on the features we wanted to implement in our mvp as well as stretch goals.

I took leadership role and was also responsible for making final desciions on the design of the app.

We ended the week with a presentation to industry judges and other developers.

Was a fun and enjoyable week. Thoroughly enjoyed working with my team and working in an Agile work flow.

## Day 73

Tuesday 23rd May

Spent the morning working on CodeWar Kata's, then continued with working on 'Supabase'. We managed to implement the social login with Github successfully, after trying many times but being stuck in a login/logout loop. We realised this happened because we had put our signInWithGithub() in the useEffect function. We worked on adding a sql database to the 'supabase' control panel and we're nearly finished having the user be able to login to the webapp and then view the table. We learnt about user permissions and managing what users have access to depending on their role. Spent the evening learning how to make a python discord bot and uploaded this onto my Github profile. Will be adding more features in the future when I have time to work on it. [https://github.com/Jakir9/pythonDiscordBot.git](https://github.com/Jakir9/pythonDiscordBot.git)

## Day 80-83

Tuesday 30th May - Friday 2nd June

We came up with the problem we would be tackling.

Our problem statement is:

"Many individuals suffering from dementia and other conditions struggle to retain memories, follow daily activities, and maintain independence due to memory loss. There is a need for a user-friendly application that provides a centralised platform for storing memories, visual and audio prompts, and daily activity reminders, tailored to the individual's objectives. This application should support multiple users, facilitating social care and improving the overall quality of life for those affected by dementia and other conditions."

This week we created:

- A team manifesto
- Our Team name
- Kanban board for project management
- Multiple ideas and problem statements
- User stories
- MVP requirements
- Low fidelity MVP wireframes
- Multiple questionaires to help us to understand our users and their needs
- Project presentation for first week
