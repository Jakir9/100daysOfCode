# 100daysOfCode Diary // School of Code Bootcamp

I will be documenting my progress for the #100daysOfCode challenge


## Day 1

Today was the welcome day for the School of Code, We had a 2-hour session where we got to meet other bootcampers and some of the leadership team.
We went through some of the basics of HTML and CSS.

We went into the different types of tags used in HTML, such as:
anchor tags, paragraphs, headers, titles, image tags

I also played around with my own basic webpage which made to have a title, Header, a paragraph and an image in the body tag.
I found the image on google and linked the image url to display on my webpage.


## Day 2 

Today I wanted to familiarise myself with DOM manipulation in JS. I found an exercise on W3 Schools with 9 exercises which helped with the topic and completed it. The link was: https://www.w3schools.com/js/exercise_js.asp?filename=exercise_js_dom_html1
It helped me get better at knowing when to use InnerText and InnerHTML. I also learnt how to change text colour, font size and whether to display text or not using purely JS DOM manipulation

I then completed the Objects exercises on the same website as I have not used objects before. I learnt how objects are made in JS and how to access an objects properties. I further tested my knowledge on JS events by completing the relevant exercise.

Completed the JS quiz https://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=JS and scored 19/25, I felt confident as I have done some JS before. However I was aiming for atleast 20/25 so I felt unhappy. I will attempt this again in a few weeks and hopefully get the full marks.

## Day 3 
Monday 13th March 2023
Today was the first day of School of Code where I learnt a lot of brand new information about the best way to learn and be efficient at problem solving.

We were also introduced to https://flukeout.github.io which is a task which helps you learn more about how css selectors work. We worked in three's and completed questions on the website and I carried on attempting questions after the session in my own time too. 


## Day 4
Tuesday 14th March 2023

Today we delve into the basics on javascript and learnt about integers, strings booleans and basic programming in JS


## Day 5 
Wednesday 15th March 2023

We explored creating objects and acessing different elements within an object. I also learnt how dictionarys and objects are similiar as they both have keys and values.

## Day 6 
Thursday 16th March 2023

Today we delve into Arrays and being able to access different elements in the array. I learnt new commands such as reverse, pop, push, shift and unshift that are used in array manipulation. We also explored nested arrays, with arrays and objects with arrays. I also learnt about string interpolation which is done using the dollar sign.

## Day 7
Friday 17th March 2023

Today I completed a hackathon with my pair programming parter. We had a series of task that we broke down into smaller tasks. The aim was to make a rock paper scissors game in JS using input from the user. We used prompts and alerts to notify and takd input from the user.

We completed this successfully along side the bonus tasks. I then used a template provided by SOC to further create another versiokn of the rock-paper-scissors which this time used buttons on the web page and displayed the result of the game too. I enjoyed the task quite a lot as it required me to learn new concepts and implement them in a working project.
