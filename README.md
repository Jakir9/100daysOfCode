# 100daysOfCode Diary // School of Code Bootcamp

I will be documenting my progress for the #100daysOfCode challenge


## Day 1

Today was the welcome day for the School of Code, We had a 2-hour session where we got to meet other bootcampers and some of the leadership team.
We went through some of the basics of HTML and CSS.

We went into the different types of tags used in HTML, such as:
anchor tags, paragraphs, headers, titles, image tags

I also played around with my own basic webpage which made to have a title, Header, a paragraph and an image in the body tag.
I found the image on google and linked the image url to display on my webpage.


## Day 2 

Today I wanted to familiarise myself with DOM manipulation in JS. I found an exercise on W3 Schools with 9 exercises which helped with the topic and completed it. The link was: https://www.w3schools.com/js/exercise_js.asp?filename=exercise_js_dom_html1
It helped me get better at knowing when to use InnerText and InnerHTML. I also learnt how to change text colour, font size and whether to display text or not using purely JS DOM manipulation
