# 100daysOfCode Diary // School of Code Bootcamp

I will be documenting my progress for the #100daysOfCode challenge


## Day 1 - 1st March 2023

Today was the welcome day for the School of Code, We had a 2-hour session where we got to meet other bootcampers and some of the leadership team.
We went through some of the basics of HTML and CSS.

We went into the different types of tags used in HTML, such as:
<a> , <p>, <h1>, <title>, <img>

I also played around with my own basic webpage which made to have a title, Header, a paragraph and an image in the body tag.
I found the image on google and linked the image url to display on my webpage.


## Day 2 - 2nd March 2023
